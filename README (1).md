## üì± Usage Tips

### For Google My Business:
- Use the full Google search URL or Maps URL
- GMB URLs look like: `https://www.google.com/search?q=BusinessName&stick=...`
- Start with smaller review counts (50-100) for testing

### For Play Store:
- Use either the full URL or just the package name
- Package names look like: `com.company.appname`
- Higher review counts provide better insights but take longer

### For Automation:
- Start with longer intervals (60+ minutes) for testing
- Monitor system resources when running automation
- Use webhook notifications to stay updated without checking manually

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Change Default Password**: Immediately change admin password
2. **Webhook URLs**: Keep webhook URLs secure and don't share publicly
3. **Google Credentials**: Store Google Service Account JSON securely
4. **Database**: The SQLite database contains user credentials
5. **Network**: Consider using HTTPS in production
