# Quick Fix for Import Issues
# Replace line 25 in reviewforge-pro-enhanced.py with this corrected import:

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer

# The original line had "text_visualizer" which should be "text"
# This is the only correction needed in the main file.
